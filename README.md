# Python-Procedures

This is just a repository of short programs like recursive selection sort, recursive map clone, and of course FizzBuzz that I've written. 

shakespearerhymeprototype uses all of shakespeare's sonnets, arranged in a nested array with each line a string, gives a rhyming line of iambic pentameter for 1032 distinct words, 271 of which are part of english's 1000 most common words.

Note that sumfunction.py, maxfunction.py, mapfunction.py, and selectionsort.py could all be written differently by using built-in python elements and avoiding recursion. However, the point of these procedures is to do functional programming in python.

From Professor Ortiz's test your skills #6 
Exercise 3. Suppose a, b, c, and d are real numbers, with 0 < a, b, c, d ≤ 50. Alice computes the product of these four numbers, exactly. Bob first rounds each of the numbers to the nearest whole number, then computes their product. Show how differentials can be used to estimate the maximum difference between Alice’s and Bob’s results.
